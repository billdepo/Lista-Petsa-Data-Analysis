Simple analysis on data concerning government funding on Greek media for informing citizens about the need to stay home during the covid-19 lockdown period

- First, we convert the data that are in raw format in a pdf file into a txt file
- Then on a Jupyter notebook we parse the data from the txt file and load them to a pandas data frame for analysis
- We present in a graph the top media in terms of the funding received by the Greek government
- Finally, we export the dataframe in an xlsx file so that it can be downloaded freely and data analysis can be easily performed on the data
